Question:
   1) Which of the following calls directly invokes the base case? (20 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("D)")
   Your answer was: D) foo(-1)
Way to go! You have earned 20 points.

Explanation: The base case leads to no further recursion, and foo(-1) causes the method to return 0 and recurse no further

Question:
   2) Using substitution, which of the following corresponds to foo(2)? (20 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("C)")
   Your answer was: C) 2*(2*(2*0 + 3) + 3) + 3
Glad you got that one! You have earned 20 points.

Explanation: There are three recursive calls, on 2, 1, and 0, followed by the base case

Question:
   3) What is the value of foo(2)? (20 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("21")
   Your answer was: 21
Nice job! You have earned 20 points.

Explanation: Evaluating the C) response

Question:
   4) Which of the following describes funtions f and g (10 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("A)")
   Your answer was: A) f is McCarthy's function and g is Ackerman's function
Nice job! You have earned 10 points.

Explanation: Easy to see from the functions on the web: f is McCarthy and g is Ackerman

Question:
   5) What is remarkable about f?(5 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("C)")
   Your answer was: C) It returns 91 when given an input 101 or smaller
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: You should have seen from running f that it returns 91 on an input 101 or less.

Question:
   6) What is remarkable about g?(10 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("D)")
   Your answer was: D) For some inputs, it will take a very long time to compute its result
Way to go! You have earned 10 points.

Explanation: Ackerman's function takes a very long time to finish even when given relatively small inputs.

Question:
   7) Using substitution which cooresponds to a(4, 6)? (15 pts)
   Grading function: answer.include?("E)")
   Your answer was: E) 2 * (2 * (3 * ( 2 * 5)))
Nice job! You have earned 15 points.

Explanation: Substitution yields 120 with the expression given for E)


Your total score is 100.
